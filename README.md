# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I coded a rock paper scissors programme in C++ based on object-oriented programming concept.

The programme consists of the following class,
1. Player
2. Human Player
3. Computer Player
4. Referee

The game requires an input (Rock, Paper or Scissors) from the human player, and the Computer will throw out a move based on 3 possible scenarios,
1. A pure random move
2. A move based on human player's most common strategy
3. A move based on computer's "winning-est" move against the human.

In adddition, the referee will validate the moves by Human and Computer, and will announce the winner in each round of battle!
