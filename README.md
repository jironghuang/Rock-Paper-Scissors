# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I coded a rock paper scissors programme in C++ based on object-oriented programming concepts.

The programme consists of the following classes,
1. Player
2. Human Player - Child of Player
3. Computer Player - Child of Player
4. Referee

The game requires an input (Rock, Paper or Scissors) from the human player, and the Computer will throw out a move based on 3 possible scenarios,
1. A pure random move
2. A move based on human player's most common strategy
3. A move based on computer's "winning-est" strategy against the human.

In adddition, the referee will validate the moves by Human and Computer, and will announce the winner in each round of battle!
